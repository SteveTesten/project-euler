/*How many routes are there through a 20x20 grid?

This can be calculated using Pascal's triangle.

This program steps through Pascal's triangle, instead of utilizing
the binomial coeficient equation.

The answer is the 20th term of the 40th row of Pascal's triangle,
or: (40!/(20!*20!))=137846528820.

See problem015.java for the equation method code, however it
can currently only calculate a maximum grid size of 10.

WORK IN PROGRESS...
